ðŸ“¢There are many different repositories with similar tests.
As the author, I do not claim absolute accuracy, but I want to show an example and the difference.

ðŸ“œThis repository contains a series of benchmarks and examples designed to investigate and compare the performance of multiprocessing and multithreading in Python. The main goal is to clearly demonstrate the impact of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) on CPU-intensive tasks and the efficiency of both approaches for I/O-intensive operations.

ðŸš€ Project Goal
Performance Assessment: Measure execution time and resource usage for tasks implemented using threads and processes.

GIL Demonstration: Show how the GIL limits true parallelism of multi-threaded CPU-intensive tasks in Python.

Choosing the Optimal Strategy: Provide practical recommendations for choosing the appropriate concurrency model depending on the nature of the task (CPU-bound or I/O-bound).

# Test results:

### 1 Single thread, single process:
Performance for 'single_thread_single_process'  
CPU times: user 0.0469s,  
sys: [Not directly captured by process_time in this granular way],  
total: 0.0469s  
Wall time: 0.7368s
